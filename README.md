### Hi there, I'm Daniel ! 👋
💭 I am focused on C++ and 3D Graphics APIs.

🔨 **I enjoy building:**
  * Helpful tools for devs and designers.
  * Eye-candy and interactive experiences.

✍ **Sometimes I write some blog posts:**
  * [Dealing with non-copyable objects - (C++ Tutorial)](https://dev.to/cambalamas/the-day-i-forbade-copy-semantics-to-an-object-nkl)
